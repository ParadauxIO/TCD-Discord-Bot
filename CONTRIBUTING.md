# Contributing 

I'm more than happy for people to contribute. 
I'm following git-flow for the purposes of this project. If you have maintainer access please create a new branch with a name which indicates the purpose of the branch, i.e what it implements. Then proceed to create a pull request based on the develop branch, if it doesn't exist create the develop branch first. 

Delete your branches once they're merged into master. 

For external contributors, fork the repository and follow the same principals, create a new branch, new PR based on develop, etc etc. I'll get to it when I can.
